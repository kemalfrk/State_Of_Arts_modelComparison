# State_Of_Arts_modelComparison

In this project, where I tested state of arts models with Alzheimer's dataset in Kaggle, I compared the success and loss values of state of arts models and visualised it at the end of the notebook. The purpose of preparing this notebook is to gain an overview of deep learning models and to get a good understanding of deep learning.

The models I used throughout the project:
1. VGG16
2. VGG19
3. ResNet50
4. ResNet101
5. MobileNet
6. MobileNetV2
7. DenseNet169
8. DenseNet121
9. Xception
